# Project Euler

This is my take at project Euler. If you want to know more about Project Euler, click [here](projecteuler.net).

This GitHub is meant for me to keep track of my progress and for others to compare their
algorithms with mine, not for blatant solutions copy. For some problems that are too specific,
I will make the function more robust to be useful with other numbers.

If you see a better way or a better algorithm on any problem, please do not hesitate to comment.
After all it is all a learning experience.

## To Run
Simply launch terminal/command line and enter the following:
```
python main.py
```
